## How its work

The api like the web application is written in Typescript

The api is based on the fully featured [Adonisjs](https://adonisjs.com/) framework

The web app combines [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework
to create the visual design

The project follows this [specifications](https://moodle.ynov.com/pluginfile.php/554817/mod_resource/content/1/Projet%20Web%20Services%20-%20Consignes.pdf)

### API

### APP

### Functionalities

Most of the functionalities are implemented :

- Log in
- Register
- Search for movie using TMDB API
- Add / Delete movies in categories
- Get / Add / Update / Delete categories
- Get / Add / Delete friend
- Get / Update / Delete user account 
- Get user profile

You can share categories via URL according to visibility levels:

- All
- Friends Only
- You Only

> **_NOTE:_** Only friends added by the user will be able to access the 'Friends only' categories

> **_NOTE:_** The 'You only' visibility does not contain a sharing url.

### TODO

Due to lack of time, here are the features that remains to be done :

- Internationalization
- Optimization

## How to install

- Clone project
- Go to root folder (where docker-compose.yml is located)
- Then run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> option '-d' launches container in detach mode

Once the containers are launched, you must launch the database migration by typing the following commands

### Run migration

The migration is executed by the ace command of the adonisjs framework, it must be launched from the cw-api container

```bash
docker exec -it cw-api sh
node ace migration:fresh --seed --force
```
The migration insert two users in the database and a category for each user

| User                | Password | Category  |              
|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| john.doe@cineweb.fr | cineweb  | Action    |
| jane.doe@cineweb.fr | cineweb  | Fantastic |

### phpMyAdmin

A phpMyAdmin is present in the docker-compose to facilitate access to the database

You can access to the phpmyadmin via http://localhost:8080

- leave server field empty
- User is cineweb
- Password is ynov69

You should see the cine-web database with the tables and fields that have been inserted 
by the migration !

### Access to application

You can now access the api and its swagger documentation via http://localhost:3333/api/docs

You can now access the web application via http://localhost:3000

> **_NOTE_** You can use the existing users to login or create your own account !
